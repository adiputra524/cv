                <p><i>As you first browse both websites, there is something noticeably different about the newspapers as well. The Sun Times seems to be screaming at you with all of the articles written in all capital letters. It doesn’t seem as appealing to the eye as
                      the New York Times’ front page, with the eloquent lettering and the articles that are written correctly. As you go on to read articles on each respected website, you can see key differences in the writing. The Sun Times is not as articulate as
                      the New York Times, this may be due to the writing styles of the columnists, but I believe that is it meant to be read by individuals of average intelligence</i></p>
